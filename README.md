# hello-opengl

A minimal and progressive collection of modern OpenGL examples written in C++.  
Each folder explores a specific graphics concept: from creating a window to implementing a free camera and lighting.

## Structure

- `hello_window/` – OpenGL context and basic window (GLFW)
- `hello_triangle/` – First triangle rendered with GLAD
- `hello_3d/` – 3D scene with free camera, user input, and basic lighting
